* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py): Python program that assigns
  a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and
  prints whether `number` is positive or negative.
  * Prints the number followed by:
    * If the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    * If the number is 0: `is zero`
    * If the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    * Followed by a new line.
  * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_py).
